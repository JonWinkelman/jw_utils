    Finds indices of simple hairpin structures with a specified minimum loop length in an RNA sequence.

    for each identified hairpin structure.

    Parameters:
    - structure (str): The RNA structure representation as a string.

    - list of tuples: A list containing tuples of (start, end) 0-index indices for matched simple hairpin structures.

    Limitations:
    - The function uses regular expressions which cannot inherently balance parentheses to match
      exact stem lengths. It identifies patterns that resemble hairpins based on loop length.
    - It is designed for simple hairpin structures and may not accurately capture all valid
